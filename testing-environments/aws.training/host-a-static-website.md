# Host a Static Website



Static websites deliver HTML, JavaScript, images, video and other files to your website visitors. Static websites are very low cost, provide high-levels of reliability, require almost no IT administration, and scale to handle enterprise-level traffic with no additional work.

**Host a static website** using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/) in the AWS console. AWS Amplify provides fully managed hosting for static websites and web apps. Amplifyâ€™s hosting solution leverages Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 to deliver your site assets via the AWS content delivery network \(CDN\).

**Set up continuous deployment:** Amplify offers a Git-based workflow with continuous deployment, allowing you to automatically deploy updates to your site on every code commit.

We need to create a repository in GitHub called amplifyapp then initialize then push the new application to github repo

echo "# amplifyapp" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Neemo0o/amplifyapp.git
git push -u origin main
```

This creates the files listed in the application then which it pushes onto the repo.
