# About Me

I have over 8 yearsâ€™ experience in the Information Technology & Services industry. I have worked in both public and private sectors, focusing on Windows Server operating systems, virtualization, hardware, networks and automation through a mixture of greenfield and brownfield projects.

This is a blog to document my journey with my AWS Cloud Practionor

I've decided to use acloudguru as my learning platform and will be documenting my learnings through here.
