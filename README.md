I am an IT Professional with an Analyst, Engineering and Systems Administration background working previously from medium to large enterprise environments. I am based in Melbourne, Australia.

I have finally  found interest and passion towards Cloud services. I have created this blog to demonstrate my knowledge and to focus more on my development towards my IT career.
