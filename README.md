I am an IT Professional with an IT Analyst, Engineering and Systems Administration background previously working in a medium to large enterprise environments. I am based in Melbourne, Australia.

I have finally found interest and passion towards Cloud services.

I will be updating this blog, focusing on educating and developing, expanding and testing Cloud services in Lab environments and demonstrating cloud infrastructure.
