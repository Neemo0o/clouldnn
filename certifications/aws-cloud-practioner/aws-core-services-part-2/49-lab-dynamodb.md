# 49 - Lab - DynamoDB

#### What we will be doing

* Create a table in DynamoDB
* Work with the data in the table.

When creating a DynamoDB, it asks you to create the name of the table and essentially will ask you to typer in the ID string etc. It will also give you default permissions but if you uncheck this it will allow you to dive deeper into the settings such as provisioning aspect. We learned earlier that the costing of this is based on the tables and read write of the data. you can configure this here.
