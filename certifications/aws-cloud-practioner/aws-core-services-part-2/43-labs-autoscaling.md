# 43 - Labs - Autoscaling

#### What are we going to do

* Define launch configuration.
* Create Autoscaling Group
* See how scaling works

When you define the launch configuration you will need to select the type of configuration  that is autoscaling. When creating the autoscaling group you can define a rule that if the CPU &gt; 20% it will add another instance and also create a rule which you can scales it down.
