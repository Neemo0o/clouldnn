#### What we are doing

* Create a Cloudfront distribution

When creating a distribution we need to ensure that you're in a region where you dont have the EC2 instance in. Upon creating the distribution you're able to choose either from Web or RMT which means either websites or media. The next section you will need to fill in some settings such as, Domain name which you can select from pre exisiting resources such as buckets, load balancers or EC2s. There are other settings also but it isn't needed for the CP exam. Go ahead and create which you'll see once you've clicked on the domain name it will point to the EC2 instance in question.
