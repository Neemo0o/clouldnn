# 41 - Lab - Route53

#### What we are doing

* Look at hosted zones
* Create resource records

Example: When you have your own domain name for example cloudnn.net. If you're wanting to use this in AWS you will need to go and use Route53 and create a hosted zone so they will give you DNS names which you can add to your registrar so that both can map from your registrar to AWS. 

Creating a record set under hosted zones will allow users to navigate to one of your EC2 instances public IP address with the domain name you've purchased.
