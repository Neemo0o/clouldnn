#### What we are doing

* Create a new MYSQL instance.

When creating a RDS - you get to choose from a different range of database, once you've chosen one there is a section for use case which means how you're going to use the database. Once chosen you need to choose which version of the database you want to install on the instance. You get the option to enable the Multi Feature also. You can also decide the storage on the database. Next you will get the estimated cost. Once done, network settings are next which you will need to fill in.
