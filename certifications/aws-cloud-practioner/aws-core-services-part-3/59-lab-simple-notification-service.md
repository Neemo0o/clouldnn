#### What will we be doing

* Create a topic
* Create email subscriber
* SQS subscriber
* Send message in the queue 

When creating a SNS - You will need to create a Topic first. Once thats created you need to add a subscription to the topic. In this case we can use email. So we can add the email into the subscriber and once that has been done. a request has been sent out to the email for the user to subscribe. Once you have you email subscribed you can go to the topic and publish a message using the publish button. This will send a message to the subscribers.
