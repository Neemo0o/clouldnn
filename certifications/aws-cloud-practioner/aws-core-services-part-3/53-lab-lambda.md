# 53 - Lab - Lambda

#### What we are doing

* Create Lambda function 
* Run lambda function

When creating a Lambda function you can choose from 3 different choices. Author from Scratch, Use Blueprint, Browse serverless app repository. When choosing author from scratch, you need to set the name up and choose the runtime which means what lanague is it going to be running. What also needs to be done is to setup an IAM Identity Access management role which needs to be created as it pushes metrics to cloudwatch. There is a section here where they create it for us, we just need to create a role name. Once you create the lambda function the next page will allow you to write your code. You can also change the runtime language here also. Down the bottom has a setting which allows you to change the memory of the function. Once you have everything ready you can go ahead and test the code. An event will need to be created for the lambda function. But once thats done you should see if the code is successful or not.
