# 8. Regions and Availability Zones

## Regions

* Amazon Web Services have regions across the world which can be used to host resources.
* They keep expanding by adding new data centers across the world
* What could influence a decision as to where you would host your resources.
* Close proximity to users
* Data required for specific region

## Availability Zone

* When you create resources in AWS, they are created in the underlying datacenter.
* AWS is responsible for maintaining the data center
* The customer is not responsible for maintaining the physical underlying infrastructure 

AWS has multiple Data center and they group it as Availability zone so when you write data on a data center it gets replicated across multiple datacenter so it ensure that the data is available. 

If one data center goes down then there is another one which has the same data for customers.
