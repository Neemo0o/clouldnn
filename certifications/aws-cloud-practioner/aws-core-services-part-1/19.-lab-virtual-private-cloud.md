# 19. Lab - Virtual Private Cloud

Here I demonstrate how to create a VPC through AWS management console. 

Important notes:

* VPC are region specific
* Within the VPC itself - there are subnets and there are 1 subnets availability zones. 
* Each availability zone has one or more datacenter

Below is an image of 6 Subnets in the one VPC in the N Virginia region
