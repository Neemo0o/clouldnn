#### Pricing calculator 

Pricing calculator is useful for companies that are on-prem which are looking to migrate services over to AWS. You dont need an account for AWS to use the pricing calculator. You can create an estimate from the pricing calculator which you will need to fill in some fields. Select a region and then add services such as EC2 instance which then allows you to configure what type of instance you need. For example, how many EC2 capacity, what CPU which then will tell you the hourly cost.

#### Billing Dashboard

Once you have EC2 instances and are running AWS services you can check how much you're getting charged by the Billing dashboard which can be found in the account section under billing dashboard. Under bill details you can see an itemised section of all your services for regions specifically. 

#### Cost Explorer

To enable Cost explorer you need to get into your accounts section inn AWS, select Cost Explorer and enable. Once enabled it will take 24hours for it to activate. Once Cost Explorer has enabled you can access this and view the cost explorer. You need data which needs to be inserted into cost explorer. If your account has only been active for 2-3 days and have only 2 services you wont be able to view alot of information.
