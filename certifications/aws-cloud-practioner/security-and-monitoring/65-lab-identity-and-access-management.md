# 65 - Lab Identity and Access Management

#### What we will be doing

* Create users
* Log on to AWS with the user credentials
* Look at assignment permissions.

When creating a user through AWS console - if you dont add any polcies or permissions on the account the user will be able to log into the management console but wont be able to access anything further than that. You can then add the exisiting in built policy such as full access to s3 to the user which enables them to have access to the S3 Bucket. You can enable MFA through the user profile and under security section.
