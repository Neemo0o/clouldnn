# 87 - Cloud Computing deployment models

#### Quick Understanding 

* Cloud deployment model
* On-prem deployment model
* Hybrid Deployment model

#### Using the cloud deployment model

* All the applications are deployed on the cloud
* applications that are hosted on the on-premis environment will be migrated over to cloud
* Advantages for applications hosted on cloud, saving cost. You dont need to invest in physical hardware
* You only pay for how much you use.
* You can use latest service on the cloud

#### Using the on-prem deployment model

* All applications are deployed on you on premise data centers
* No applications are deployed on cloud
* Advantage is that you have complete control over your infrastructure 
* The disadvantage is that you have to invest into the infrastructure

#### Using the Hybrid deployment model

* Here the applications are deployed on both cloud on on premise enviornment
* Use both benefits of both environments
* Use services to connect both environments together. AWS site to site VPN connection/ Direct connect
* Save on cost on cloud deployments
