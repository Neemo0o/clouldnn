#### Stop guessing capacity

* When companies deploy applications on their on-premise data centers, they need to decide on aspects such as - 
* How many servers does the application require 
* How much storage does the company need to invest on
* If the application starts to grow, how much should we invest on an on-going basis
* When using AWS Cloud, you dont need to worry on these aspects such as these
* You can spin up an instance when you want 
* You can scale up based on demand
* Terminate infrastructure when no longer required

#### Increase Speed and agility

* You dont need to make teams to wait before infrastructure is ready.
* With services such as AWS Beanstalk you can spin up an environment quickly for your development team
* Creating an EC2 instance takes only minutes
* You can create Relational database service in a few minutes also

#### Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres

* Apart from capital expenses on infrastructure, you can also incur operational expenses as well.
