# 86 - Cloud Service Models - IaaS, PaaS and Saas

#### Quick Understanding 

* Infrastructure as a service
* Platform as a service
* Software as a service

#### What is Infrastructure as a service

* Here the underlying infrastructure is managed by AWS
* A common example of IaaS is the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud Service
* Here you manage the instance but you dont manage the underlying physical infrastructure
* The advantage is that you dont have the burden to manage the physical infrastructure
* This helps to reduce capital cost - You don't need to invest in physical hardware
* It also helps to reduce operational expenditure, you dont need to worry about adding storage, servers, cooling and networking

#### What is Platform as a service

* Here the underlying infrastructure is managed by AWS
* The virtualised environment is also managed by AWS
* A common example of a PaaS is the AWS Relational Database Service - With this service the time consuming activites or hardware, managing capacity, managing the virtual machines are managed by AWS. 
* This service gives you high availbility, fast performance, backup and restore features.

#### What is Software as a service

* Here the underlying infrastructure is managed by AWS
* Virtualised environment is managed by AWS
* Also the underlying software is managed by AWS
* Here the advantage is that you dont have to manage the software. 
* A common example of a SaaS is email service
