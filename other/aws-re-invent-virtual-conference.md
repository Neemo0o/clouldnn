# AWS re:Invent Virtual Conference

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2823%29.png)

  
AWS re:Invent 2020 is the Amazon Web Services annual user conference that focuses on:

* Cloud strategies
* Cloud operations
* Security and developer productivity
* IT architecture and infrastructure

Typically, the conference spans seven different properties in Las Vegas and welcomes over 60,000 attendees over the course of a few days. This year, the event will be 100% virtual, taking place over three weeks, Monday November 30th to Friday December 18th.

This year’s re:Invent will “follow the sun”, with broadcasts repeating to serve multiple time zones \(Americas \(PST\), Asia-Pacific \(SGT\), Europe \(GMT\).  These sessions, including keynote sessions, will happen live in the Americas and then will be rebroadcast at the designated times in the two other time zones.  The event will feature hundreds of content streaming sessions, interactive favourites \(like DeepRacer, GameDay, and Jams\), as well as keynotes and leadership sessions.  

I will be documenting my learning from the conference through here.
