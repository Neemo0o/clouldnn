# acloudguru

I've decided to use acloudguru as my learning platform and will be documenting my learning through here.

I've been been looking at different certifications from AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Linux and Containers.

I will be starting with the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification which has 10 hours of content, 52 total lessons, 4 quizzes, 1 practice exam.
